# ðŸ§© BuildThe6ix â€“ 3D Puzzle Project

Team Project | University of Waterloo | Fall 2023

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**BuildThe6ix** is a collaborative 3D puzzle that celebrates the architectural and cultural essence of Toronto - affectionately known as "The 6ix." Designed and prototyped by a multidisciplinary team, the puzzle recreates a scaled-down version of the CN Tower and key buildings from the Financial District. Each piece was carefully engineered for 3D printing, snap-fit assembly, and hands-on engagement, making it both educational and interactive.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Capture the skyline of Toronto through a modular, hands-on puzzle. 
- Utilize SolidWorks to design accurate, interlocking puzzle pieces. 
- Optimize the model for FDM 3D printing using Prusa i3 MK3S and PLA material.
- Encourage STEAM education by combining engineering, design, and city-building concepts. 

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Technologies

- **CAD Software**: SolidWorks
- **Slicing Software**: PrusaSlicer
- **3D Printer**: Prusa i3 MK3S 
- **Material**: PLA Filament

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- Consists of 9 unique, geometrically precise puzzle pieces. 
- Features snap-git joints for tool-free, repeatable assembly.
- Fully 3D-printable on standard FDM printers, enabling reproducibility for classroom or outreach purposes.

## ðŸ’¡ Value & Impact
- Encourages spatial reasoning and design thinking in a fun, accessible format.
- Demonstrates practical skills in CAD modelling, prototyping, and additive manufacturing.
- Serves as a creative tool for workshops or educational demos around Toronto architecture, 3D design, or engineering principles.
